# Social Auth SwiftUI

This is a boilerplate project mobile app built with Clean Architecture and MVVM.
The source code structure is built with the criteria that it can be upgraded to Micro Front-End architecture if the scope of the project expands.

This repository contains all source code flutter for the project.

-  Language: SwiftUI 5
- IDE:  Xcode
- Deployment target
    -  iOS: `10.0+.`
- Device Orientation: Portrail (primary)
- Standard design: iPhone XS (375x812 @3x)
- flavor: n/a (development | production)

# Architecture

Apply Clean Architecture + MVVM (with ViewModel used to replace the traditional ViewModel).

### UI
- This is the main interface of the application. It is classified into 3 main categories as:
   - Screen
   - Epic
   - Shared UI
- UI Layout can be Stateless or Stateful depending on its intended use and scope.
- UI Layout listens to the State that ViewModel sends and displays based on that data
- With Shared UI, it is located in the `App/Presentation/Shared/` folder. Depending on the purpose of use, it comes with a ViewModel (grouped in a feature folder) or is only placed individually and uses a certain Shared ViewModel.

### ViewModel
- It aims to handle business logic for a specific view such as validation, retrieve data, ...
- ViewModel uses use-case to retrieve data or handle domain business logic
- ViewModel listens to events from UI Layout -> handles logic and returns results to UI Layout with specific State

### UseCase
- It's the main layer to handle all data business
- It's a stateless layer, so it will be constructed on demand
- A use-case usually handle one use-case of a specific epic
- A use-case can communicate with other use-cases
- All use-case **MUST** be defined with an interface (abstract class), use-case communicate with view-model through by the interface 
- Constructor in UseCases class (DI class)

### Repository
- It's imported from local framework project name *Repository*
- The main data source of app that is used by service layer
- It's a stateless layer, so it will be constructed on demand
- It contains a little bit business rules to branch data source that should be used, from client or dao
- It also handle the caching logic rules, from memory or local storage
- All repositories **MUST** be defined with an interface (abstract class), service communicate with repository through by the interface 
- Constructor in Repository class (DI class)

### API
- It's data source layer, client means data is from RestFul API and LocalStorage means data is from local storage
- API is advanced class to handle all generic calling API, retry when access token is expired and need to refresh, also for general API error handling
- LocalStorage is advanced class to handle the generic storage, save/get list or item, or even for a string or an integer

### Model
- It covers all entities in app
- Have 2 kind of models, entity and model.
- Model is belong to repository, it defines all entity's properties and support basic parsing with JSON
- Entity is belong to UI layer, it defines all utility methods of an entity

## Dependencies Injection
- There are kinds of class to support construct instance for DI là Service, ViewModel, UseCases Repository,...
- Simple direct Service Locator that allows to decouple the interface from a concrete implementation and to access the concrete implementation from everywhere in your App
